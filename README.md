The PPG Industry Talk 1 provided valuable exposure to real-world applications of technology within a multinational organisation. Through the sharing sessions by industry professionals from PPG, I gained clearer insights into how data analytics, IT infrastructure, cloud architecture, and SAP systems are integrated to support large-scale business operations. The speakers shared how data analytics, IT infrastructure, cloud architecture, and SAP systems are used to manage data, improve operational efficiency, and support decision-making across the organisation. This talk helped me understand the important role of technology in ensuring smooth operations, system reliability, and data-driven strategies in a large manufacturing industry like PPG.

The industrial talk could be improved by including more live demonstrations, such as real examples of SAP dashboards or data analytics used in manufacturing processes. In addition, providing a hands-on activity would help students better understand how technology solutions are implemented in real industrial settings. Overall, the talk broadened my perspective on technology careers in the manufacturing sector. It motivated me to enhance my technical knowledge and stay adaptable to emerging technologies, as these skills are essential in supporting innovation and efficiency in companies like PPG.
